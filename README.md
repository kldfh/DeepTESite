# DeepTESite
We propose DeepTESite model based on the Transformer Encoder, using Acid Sequence Symmetric Position Encodings (ASSPE) and Bidirectional Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (BMAM) for arginine methylation sites prediction. In our DeepTESite, ASSPE is firstly addressed based on the symmetry hypothesis of methylation, resulting in effectively integrating the positional information and halving the computational cost of position encoding. To further improve feature extraction capability, the BMAM is applied, which can extract contextual information of the amino acid sequence in the sequential and spatial information for prediction. Compared with the current high-accuracy arginine methylation sites prediction model, we empirically show that the accuracy of our proposed DeepTESite model is 87.88 % and our DeepTESite outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for arginine methylation sites prediction.
